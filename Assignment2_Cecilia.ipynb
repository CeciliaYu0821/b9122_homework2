      "Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message to the International Climate and Energy Summit, in Madrid today:I am pleased to join you for this International Climate and Energy Summit.  And I thank the Government of Spain and the International Energy Agency for bringing us together.You meet in Madrid to strengthen the coalition to respond to a defining challenge of our times:  Saving the 1.5°C limit, by cleaning up global energy.  Time is short, but it is possible.  The International Energy Agency’s new Net Zero Roadmap shows us that.  But we need action now.First, action at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change].  I urge you to work together, in Madrid, and in the United Arab Emirates, to secure a strong outcome in response to the Global Stocktake.  That must include commitments to double energy efficiency, triple renewables capacity, cut methane from the energy sector by 75 per cent, and ensure universal access to energy — all by 2030.These efforts must be accompanied by a collective commitment to accelerate a fair and just phase-out of fossil fuels, as we bring clean power to all.  One without the other equals failure.Second, action from Governments.  I have proposed an Acceleration Agenda.  This calls on Governments to speed up net-zero timelines — so that developed countries get there as close as possible to 2040 and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050.  And it urges all Governments to put in place credible actions, policies and plans that are compatible with a 1.5°C world, and for developed countries to deliver climate justice to those on the front lines of the crisis.That includes, amongst other measures, putting a stop to new coal and phasing out existing coal; shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables — subsidies the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates reached $7 trillion last year; and ending new oil and gas licensing.Developed countries must honour the $100 billion commitment, and replenish the Green Climate Fund.  And we must push the multilateral development banks to adapt their business models to leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries so they can reduce emissions and adapt.Third, we need action from business.  The Acceleration Agenda calls on companies — including fossil fuel companies — to create credible transition plans across the entire value chain.  All this is eminently achievable.The Climate Ambition Summit I hosted in New York last month indicated a collective way forward.  And it showed that action to meet the 1.5°C limit is not a dream.  It is practical and it is possible.  We know what needs to be done.  Let’s do it.\n",

      "Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks at the Global Citizen Festival, in New York today:Hello, New York.  You are really quiet today.  Hello, New York.Come rain or shine, we’re here because we are committed to our planet.  And what happens today is a reflection of leaders meeting all week, promises made seven years ago, and today we’re recommitting to what the great Al Pacino said, tell it like it is:  it’s half-time, and we’re down … but we’re not out.People are hurting, and wars are raging, and our planet has gone from warming to boiling.  Leaders are really struggling to use their power to keep the promises of the global goals and they risk breaking that promise to billions of people.The good news is, we still got seven years to go, and every game is won or lost in the second half.  So, what are you going to do?  Are you sitting on the sidelines?  No.  Are you changing the world?  Yes.  I didn’t hear you.  Are you changing the world?Well, at the United Nations, we’re joining you, we are mobilizing people around the world.  But we can’t do this alone.  We need all hands on deck — and we need each and every one of you.We need leaders to urgently tackle the climate crisis because we can’t win unless we stop our world from heating up.  We need leaders to bridge the digital divide — because we can’t win if billions of people, especially girls, are left offline and left behind. And we need leaders to achieve gender equality — because we can’t win when half the team isn’t even on the field.So, New Yorkers, it’s crunch time — but crunch time is when champions are made.Let’s unite and fight together — inch by inch — to keep the promise of achieving the global goals by 2030.  New York, are you with me?  New York, are you with the world?\n",

      "Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message to the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), today:My visits to small island States in the Caribbean and the Pacific have had an enormous impact on me and my ideas on the role of multilateral institutions.I have seen some of the most beautiful places on Earth, but I have also seen the enormity of the threat you face from climate chaos — a threat that is existential.  And I have witnessed the leadership, resilience and unity you bring to the table.Today, your countries are at the centre of a storm of global problems you have done almost nothing to create:  the continued, brutal economic impacts of the pandemic, soaring food and fuel prices, crippling debts and the climate crisis, accelerating with a deadly force that can wipe out homes and livelihoods in moments.It is little wonder you are struggling to invest in climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals.  That means livelihoods being lost, communities without health care, and young people left to wonder whether the place they call home can survive.We need global action to end these crises.  First, on climate justice:  we need AOSIS to continue its climate advocacy.  To keep using your moral authority to push the G7 and the G20 to slash emissions and limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C.Small island States do not lack ambition, they lack finance. Developed countries must deliver, honouring the promise of $100 billion a year, replenishing the Green Climate Fund, and delivering a road map to double adaptation finance by 2025.At COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], all parties must operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, which you have done so much to champion.  And every person on earth must be protected by an early warning system by 2027. I thank all of you involved in the Early Warning Systems for All Initiative.Second, action on financial justice.  I am calling for fundamental reform of our outdated and unfair global financial architecture.  And I have proposed an SDG Stimulus to increase resources for sustainable development and provide effective debt relief.Loan agreements must include disaster clauses.  And we must remove the barriers that prevent some small island States from accessing affordable finance.Most small island States are middle-income countries.  We need to move past a system that allocates concessional finance depending on national income, to one that considers vulnerability and resilience.  The work of the High-Level Panel of the Multi-Dimensional Vulnerability Index is vital.  And I hope there will be political consensus on the way forward.Next year’s Conference on Small Island Developing States in Antigua and Barbuda, will be an opportunity to bring the international community together around the challenges you face.  With global action for climate justice and financial justice, we can create the change you need.  The United Nations is with you, every step of the way.\n"

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the ministerial meeting on the Summit of the Future, in New York today:My report on Our Common Agenda called for renewed trust and solidarity between peoples, countries and generations.  It proposed a reformed multilateralism to reflect and address today’s political and economic realities.Today, the need for such reforms is clearer than ever.  We face a host of consequential and even existential risks, without the multilateral systems needed to manage them.  We are moving towards a multipolar world.Multipolarity is creating new opportunities for different countries to lead on the global stage.  But, history teaches that multipolarity without strong multilateral institutions creates serious risks.  It could result in even greater geostrategic tensions, chaotic competition and further fragmentation.Multilateral institutions will only survive if they are truly universal.  The Summit of the Future is a unique opportunity to help rebuild trust and bring outdated multilateral institutions and frameworks into line with today’s world, based on equity and solidarity.  But, it is more than an opportunity.  It is an essential means of reducing risks and creating a safer and more peaceful world.I welcome your agreement that the Summit of the Future will adopt an intergovernmentally negotiated Pact for the Future, reaffirming the United Nations Charter; reinvigorating multilateralism; boosting implementation of existing commitments; and agreeing on solutions to new challenges.I also welcome your decision to work towards a Pact covering five baskets of issues: sustainable development and financing for development; international peace and security; science, technology and innovation, and digital cooperation; youth and future generations; [and] transforming global governance.I commend your pledge to advance human rights, the empowerment of women and girls, and acceleration towards the Sustainable Development Goals.  You, the Member States, will decide what to take forward within these five groups of issues into the Pact for the Future.We have shared a series of concrete proposals for your consideration in eleven policy briefs. These proposals cover:  A New Agenda for Peace that would reinvigorate our collective security framework; a global financial system that works for all; economic metrics that go beyond GDP [gross domestic product] to underpin policy decisions; a compact that would harness the benefits and manage the risks of digital technologies and artificial intelligence; a voluntary code of conduct on information integrity online; new protocols to manage global shocks more effectively; stronger cooperation in outer space; a transformation of education systems; the meaningful inclusion of young people in global decision‑making processes; ways to safeguard the future and uphold the rights of future generations; and a UN 2.0, better equipped to support Member States through the use of data, digital tools, innovation, foresight and behavioural science.Our proposals deepen the vision of Our Common Agenda, turning the original recommendations into concrete, achievable steps towards fairer, more sustainable, universal and effective global systems.  I also welcome the contributions of the High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, which deserve your serious consideration and I thank the Co-Chair for the excellent work that was done by the group.And I commend the progress that has already been made on many of the mandated Our Common Agenda recommendations, through the debates convened last year by the President of the General Assembly; the establishment of the UN Youth Office; the five transformative measures for gender equality; the new vision for the rule of law; the Global Accelerator on jobs and social protection; and plans for the proposed open Biennial Summit among members of the G20 [Group of 20], ECOSOC [Economic and Social Council], leaders of international financial institutions and myself as Secretary-General of the United Nations.The Pact for the Future will be your contract with each other and with your people.  It represents your pledge to use all the tools at your disposal at the global level to solve problems, before those problems overwhelm us.  The challenges we face are universal. They require universal solutions and cannot be solved through small groupings of states or coalitions of the willing.The United Nations is the only forum where this can happen.  It will also be important to welcome the contributions of civil society, academia, the private sector and other important stakeholders.The stakes are high.  A substantive, comprehensive Pact for the Future has the potential to turbocharge implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in line with the declaration of the SDG Summit. It will help to determine whether we meet the serious challenges of today and tomorrow, or continue down the path of social, financial, political and environmental breakdown.  Let me stress that this Pact will fully complement and reinforce our efforts to achieve the SDGs and create a more peaceful, sustainable and equitable world today. But, let’s be clear.  Time is not on our side.  In the two years since my report on Our Common Agenda, new conflicts have emerged and geopolitical tensions are higher than ever.  We have crossed a new Rubicon with generative AI. We are seeing the signs of climate breakdown.  Billions of people around the world have been hit by the cost-of-living crisis.  And more countries than ever are struggling with debt distress or default.We cannot inch towards agreement while the world races towards a precipice.  We must bring a new urgency to our efforts, and a shared sense of common purpose.  Let us draw inspiration from recent global agreements on global biodiversity, on the high seas, on climate loss and damage, and on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.Reaching agreement will be difficult.  But, it is possible.  I urge you to redouble your efforts over the coming year to ensure that the Pact for the Future is ambitious and transformative.The Summit of the Future must also be a moment to reinforce the connection between global governance and the people of the world.  The Pact for the Future must reflect the priorities and concerns of women and men struggling to feed their families, and communities bearing the brunt of the climate emergency.  It must offer solutions for a better, fairer, more peaceful and more sustainable world. Above all, it must demonstrate that multilateralism can deliver for everyone, everywhere.  Thank you.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council open debate on “Upholding the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter through Effective Multilateralism:  Maintenance of Peace and Security of Ukraine”, in New York today:The United Nations Charter is our roadmap to a more peaceful world.  The tools and mechanisms founded on the principles of the Charter are a how-to manual to resolve conflict.  Together, our collective efforts over the years have contributed to preventing war on a global scale and saving millions of lives through peacemaking and preventive diplomacy, UN peacekeeping operations, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, humanitarian and development programmes, and activities to promote human rights.Just this week, the SDG Summit agreed on a rescue plan for the Sustainable Development Goals — an essential tool to prevent conflict and crises of all kinds.  Multilateralism works.  It is essential and effective.  But multilateral tools and mechanisms are weakening.  In the face of rising geopolitical tensions and challenges, some are failing while others — frameworks that are urgently needed — do not yet exist.The number of conflict-related deaths last year almost doubled.  United Nations peace operations are under unprecedented strain.  Nuclear disarmament is at a virtual standstill.  And there are no adequate global frameworks to address the security threats posed by new technologies.I urge Governments to go further and do better to recommit to their obligations under the United Nations Charter, to use the full range of diplomatic tools that it provides, to prioritize the prevention of conflict and crises and to consider the proposals for new frameworks and tools in the New Agenda for Peace.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in clear violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, is aggravating geopolitical tensions and divisions, threatening regional stability, increasing the nuclear threat, and creating deep fissures in our increasingly multipolar world.  All this comes at a time when cooperation and compromise for multilateral solutions are needed more than ever to tackle challenges from the climate crisis to unprecedented levels of inequality to disruptive technologies.The United Nations organs have been clear in condemning the war. The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved one resolution demanding that Russia leave Ukraine, and a second rejecting Russia’s efforts to annex Ukrainian territory.  I have consistently and repeatedly called for a just and sustainable peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter and international law — for Ukraine, for Russia, and for the world.Russia’s invasion was followed by relentless, systematic attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure and services, including health and education facilities.  The war has killed or injured tens of thousands of civilians, destroyed lives and livelihoods, traumatized a generation of children, torn families and communities apart, devastated the economy and turned vast areas of farmland into deadly minefields.Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop immediately.  Nearly half of Ukraine’s population — some 18 million people — need humanitarian assistance and protection.  More than 6 million Ukrainians have fled the country.  The United Nations has worked collectively to mitigate the impact on people, both in Ukraine and around the world and to support civilians. Our humanitarian programmes have stepped up, distributing aid to more than 8 million people this year in partnership with over 450 humanitarian organizations, half of them Ukrainian.The International Atomic Energy Agency has established a presence at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and other major Ukrainian nuclear sites, to monitor safety, security and safeguards.  Together with the International Committee of the Red Cross, we successfully organized the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol last year.Evidence of shocking and widespread human rights violations has been documented by UN agencies, including conflict-related sexual violence, arbitrary detentions; summary executions — mostly by the Russian Federation — and the forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians, including children, to territory under Russian control or to the Russian Federation. This documentation is vital for accountability.  Accountability for all human rights violations is crucial, in line with international norms and standards.The war contributed to an unprecedented surge in global food prices, threatening millions with hunger and poverty.  Starting in July 2022, we succeeded in mitigating that impact through the Black Sea Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Nations and the Russian Federation.During its one-year period of operation, the Black Sea Initiative, together with the Memorandum of Understanding on facilitating exports of Russian food products and fertilizers, helped to reduce global food prices by over 23 per cent from the record high reached in March last year. The Black Sea Initiative enabled the export of nearly 33 million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs and allowed the World Food Programme to transport 725,000 metric tons of wheat for humanitarian aid to countries including Afghanistan and Somalia.Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the United Nations delivered solutions on several of the most challenging areas of trade facilitation for Russian food and fertilizers, with continuous work on the remaining issues.We deeply regret that Russia ended its participation in the Black Sea Initiative in July of this year.  And that, immediately upon leaving, Russia launched a bombardment of Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities on the Black Sea and the Danube River.Attacks against terminals and grain stores are unacceptable and such assaults must end.  Civilian shipping in the Black Sea has also been threatened.  Further escalation could instantly shock the markets and destabilize the region.  Volatility and uncertainty have already returned to international grain markets, while supplies from the harvest in Ukraine pile up.The bombardment is also undermining our efforts in the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Russian Federation. It has led many of those whose goodwill is needed, notably in the private sector, to question whether there is any real interest in re-joining the Black Sea Initiative.We remain engaged with all parties, aiming to ensure safe and secure exports of grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine. These must be put on a stable footing, without the repeated threat of interruption. I am grateful to the Government of Türkiye for its contributions and urge all Member States to support our efforts.The United Nations continues to work towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter, international law, and the resolutions of the General Assembly.  I urge all countries to do their part to prevent further escalation, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace.  We are fully committed to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders.This war is already causing limitless suffering.  Its continuation risks further perilous escalation.  There is never an alternative to dialogue, diplomacy, and a just peace.  Thank you.\n"

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ opening remarks to the Climate Ambition Summit, in New York today:Our focus here is on climate solutions — and our task is urgent. Humanity has opened the gates of hell. Horrendous heat is having horrendous effects.  Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands are fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.Climate action is dwarfed by the scale of the challenge.  If nothing changes we are heading towards a 2.8°C temperature rise — towards a dangerous and unstable world.But, the future is not fixed.  It is for leaders like you to write it.  We can still limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C.  We can still build a world of clear air, green jobs and affordable clean power for all.The path forward is clear.  It has been forged by fighters and trailblazers — some of whom are with us today:  Activists refusing to be silenced; indigenous peoples defending their lands from climate extremes; chief executives transforming their business models and financiers funding a just transition; mayors moving towards to a zero-carbon future; and Governments working to stamp out fossil fuels and protect vulnerable communities.But, if we are to meet the 1.5°C limit and protect ourselves from climate extremes, climate champions, particularly in the developing world, need solidarity, they need support and they need global leaders to take action.  Action to reduce emissions.The move from fossil fuels to renewables is happening — but we are decades behind.  We must make up time lost to foot-dragging, arm-twisting and the naked greed of entrenched interests raking in billions from fossil fuels.The proposed Climate Solidarity Pact calls on major emitters — who have benefitted most from fossil fuels — to make extra efforts to cut emissions, and on wealthy countries to support emerging economies to do so.And the Acceleration Agenda I proposed calls on Governments to hit fast forward:  So that developed countries reach net zero as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.It also urges countries to implement a fair, equitable and just energy transition, while providing affordable electricity to all: By ensuring credible plans to exit coal by 2030 for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and 2040 for the rest of the world; by ending fossil fuel subsidies — which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates reached an incredible $7 trillion in 2022; and by setting ambitious renewable energy goals in line with the 1.5°C limit.The Acceleration Agenda also calls for climate justice.  Many of the poorest nations have every right to be angry.  Angry that they are suffering most from a climate crisis they did nothing to create. Angry that promised finance has not materialized.  And angry that their borrowing costs are sky-high.We need a transformation to rebuild trust.  Governments must push the global financial system towards supporting climate action.  That means putting a price on carbon, and overhauling the business models of multilateral development banks so that they leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.All parties must operationalize the loss and damage fund at the twenty-eighth UN Climate Change Conference.  Developed countries must meet the $100 billion commitment, replenish the Green Climate Fund and double adaptation funding.  And everyone must be covered by an early warning system by 2027 — by implementing the action plan we launched last year.At the same time, my Acceleration Agenda calls for business and financial institutions to embark on true net-zero pathways.  Shady pledges have betrayed the public trust.  Shamefully, some companies have even tried to block the transition to net zero — using wealth and influence to delay, distract and deceive.Every company that truly means business must create just transition plans that credibly cut emissions and deliver climate justice, in line with the recommendations of my High-Level Expert Group.The future of humanity is in your hands.  One summit will not change the world.  But, today can be a powerful moment to generate momentum, that we build on over the coming months.We can — and we must turn up the tempo.  Turn plans into action.  And turn the tide.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks at the General Assembly High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, in New York today:Of all the issues we will discuss this week, finance may be the most crucial, because financing for development is the fuel that drives progress on the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement [for climate change]. Today, that fuel is running out and the sustainable development engine is stuttering, stalling and backfiring.As we mark the halfway point of the Sustainable Development Goals, progress on our most fundamental priorities — poverty and hunger — has gone into reverse for the first time in decades.  The COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis are having a devastating and lasting impact on developing economies.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated volatility and increased prices for food, energy and finance.  A global cost-of-living crisis is affecting billions of people.  Governments are drowning in debt.  Soaring interest rates are squeezing developing countries dry.Official development assistance and climate finance commitments are not being met.  There is a stark and growing divide between countries that can access financing at reasonable terms and those that cannot and are being left even further behind.The figures tell their own story.  Let me provide three.  The SDG financing gap has become a chasm, estimated at $3.9 trillion a year.  Developing countries face borrowing costs up to eight times higher than those of European countries in particular, and this is a debt trap.And one in three countries around the world is now at high risk of a fiscal crisis.  Over 40 per cent of people living in extreme poverty are in countries with severe debt challenges.There have been some good-faith efforts to help developing economies survive this financing crisis, including the G20 [Group of 20] Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the distribution of special drawing rights by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  But, they are not enough.It is clear that the systemic problems of financing for sustainable development require a systemic solution:  reforms of the global financial architecture.  That architecture was created at a time when many of today’s developing countries were still under colonial rule.  It is deeply skewed in favour of the developed world.And it has not kept pace with the growth of the global economy.  The paid-in capital of the World Bank for example as a percentage of global GDP is one fifth what it was in 1960.I reiterate my call for a new Bretton Woods moment when countries come together to agree on a global financial architecture that reflects today’s economic realities and power relations.  I count on your support for these proposed reforms, through the Summit of the Future and beyond.But, while these structural reforms are essential, they will take time — and time is short.  The 2030 Agenda may fall beyond our reach before they bear fruit.  I am therefore calling on Governments to take immediate steps to rescue the SDGs.My proposed SDG Stimulus would release at least $500 billion per year in affordable long-term financing for investments in sustainable development and climate action.  Increasing the capital base of multilateral development banks and changing their business model would enable Governments to scale up development and climate investments significantly.Recapitalization and stronger engagement with credit rated agencies would enable the banks to transform their approach to risk, improving their lending terms and leveraging massive amounts of private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.Governments could create an effective debt workout mechanism to support payment suspensions, include private creditors, and extend to middle-income countries.  They can also increase contingency financing when countries run into trouble.  I am calling for the rechannelling of an additional $100 billion of special drawing rights, primarily through the multilateral development banks, and for other innovative methods to help countries in need.Developed countries must make good on their finance commitments to developing countries, including on climate.  They must meet the $100 billion promise, significantly increase adaptation finance, replenish the Green Climate Fund and operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund by COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ].  And all countries must align national budgets with the SDGs, and address tax abatement and illicit financial flows.Discussions on reform on the financing architecture are taking place from Bridgetown to Paris to Delhi.  I welcome the G20’s support for the SDG Stimulus, strengthening Multilateral Development Banks, and increasing finance for development and climate action.The SDG Summit Declaration is a ringing endorsement of strong financing measures to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.  Now we must move from words to urgent action, because the SDGs — a promise to the people of the world — cannot wait.  A two-track world of haves and have-nots is already driving a crisis in global trust.I urge you to use this high-level dialogue as a platform for constructive engagement, with a focus on creative and practical financing solutions that can be taken forward in the next months and years.  Together, we must turn this moment of crisis into a moment of opportunity, find joint financing solutions to rebuild global solidarity, and create new momentum for sustainable development and climate action. And I thank you.\n",

      "Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ address to the opening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, in New York today:Just nine days ago, many of the world’s challenges coalesced in an awful hellscape.  Thousands of people in Derna, Libya, lost their lives in epic, unprecedented flooding. They were victims many times over — victims of years of conflict, victims of climate chaos, victims of leaders, near and far, who failed to find a way to peace.The people of Derna lived and died in the epicentre of that indifference, as the skies unleashed 100 times the monthly rainfall in 24 hours, as dams broke after years of war and neglect, as everything they knew was wiped off the map.Even now, as we speak, bodies are washing ashore from the same Mediterranean Sea where billionaires sunbathe on their superyachts. Derna is a sad snapshot of the state of our world — the flood of inequity, of injustice, of inability to confront the challenges in our midst.Our world is becoming unhinged.  Geopolitical tensions are rising.  Global challenges are mounting.  And we seem incapable of coming together to respond.  We confront a host of existential threats — from the climate crisis to disruptive technologies — and we do so at a time of chaotic transition.For much of the cold war, international relations were largely seen through the prism of two superpowers.  Then came a short period of unipolarity.  Now we are rapidly moving towards a multipolar world.  This is, in many ways, positive.  It brings new opportunities for justice and balance in international relations.  But, multipolarity alone cannot guarantee peace.At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe had numerous Powers.  It was truly multipolar.  But, it lacked robust multilateral institutions and the result was the First World War.A multipolar world needs strong and effective multilateral institutions.  Yet global governance is stuck in time.  Look no further than the United Nations Security Council and the Bretton Woods system. They reflect the political and economic realities of 1945, when many countries in this Assembly Hall were still under colonial domination.The world has changed.  Our institutions have not.  We cannot effectively address problems as they are if institutions do not reflect the world as it is.  Instead of solving problems, they risk becoming part of the problem.  And indeed, divides are deepening:  divides among economic and military Powers, divides between north and south, east and west.We are inching ever closer to a great fracture in economic and financial systems and trade relations, one that threatens a single, open internet, with diverging strategies on technology and artificial intelligence, and potentially clashing security frameworks.It is high time to renew multilateral institutions based on twenty-first century economic and political realities, rooted in equity, solidarity and universality and anchored in the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.That means reforming the Security Council in line with the world of today.  It means redesigning the international financial architecture so that it becomes truly universal and serves as a global safety net for developing countries in trouble.I have no illusions.  Reforms are a question of power.  I know there are many competing interests and agendas.  But, the alternative to reform is not the status quo. The alternative to reform is further fragmentation.  It is reform or rupture.At the same time, divides are also widening within countries. Democracy is under threat. Authoritarianism is on the march. Inequalities are growing.  And hate speech is on the rise.  In the face of all these challenges and more, compromise has become a dirty word.Our world needs statesmanship, not gamesmanship and gridlock. As I told the G20 [Group of 20], it is time for a global compromise.  Politics is compromise.  Diplomacy is compromise.  Effective leadership is compromise.  Leaders have a [special] responsibility to achieve compromise in building a common future of peace and prosperity for our common good.Over the past year, we have shown the promise of multilateral action.  With important new agreements on safeguarding biodiversity — on protecting the high seas, on climate loss and damage, on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.We have all the tools and resources to solve our shared challenges.  What we need is determination.  Determination is in the DNA of our United Nations — summoning us with the first words of the Charter:  “We the peoples of the United Nations […] determined”:  determined to end the scourge of war; determined to reaffirm faith in human rights; determined to uphold justice and respect international law; and determined to promote social progress and better lives for all people.It falls to us — through our actions — to apply that determination to the challenges of today being faithful to the Charter of the United Nations.  It starts with determination to uphold the Charter’s pledge for peace.Yet, instead of ending the scourge of war, we are seeing a surge of conflicts, coups and chaos.  If every country fulfilled its obligations under the Charter, the right to peace would be guaranteed.  When countries break those pledges, they create a world of insecurity for everyone.Exhibit A:  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The war, in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, has unleashed a nexus of horror:  lives destroyed, human rights abused, families torn apart, children traumatized, hopes and dreams shattered.But, beyond Ukraine, the war has serious implications for us all.  Nuclear threats put us all at risk.  Ignoring global treaties and conventions makes us all less safe.  And the poisoning of global diplomacy obstructs progress across the board.We must not relent in working for peace — a just peace in line with the UN Charter and international law.  And even while fighting rages, we must pursue every avenue to ease the suffering of civilians in Ukraine and beyond.  The Black Sea Initiative was one such avenue.  The world badly needs Ukrainian food and Russian food and fertilizers to stabilize markets and guarantee food security and I will not give up on my efforts to make it happen.Around the globe, old tensions fester while new risks emerge. Nuclear disarmament is at a standstill while countries develop new weapons and make new threats.  Across the Sahel, a series of coups is further destabilizing the region as terrorism is gaining ground.  Sudan is descending into full-scale civil war, millions have fled and the country risks splitting apart.In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, millions are displaced and gender-based violence is a horrific daily reality.  In Haiti, a country that suffered centuries of colonial exploitation is today overwhelmed by gang violence, and still awaits international support.In Afghanistan, a staggering 70 per cent of the population needs humanitarian assistance with the rights of women and girls systematically denied.  In Myanmar, brutal violence, worsening poverty and repression are crushing hopes for a return to democracy.In the Middle East, escalating violence and bloodshed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is taking a terrible toll on civilians. Unilateral actions are intensifying and undermining the possibility of a two-State solution — the only pathway to lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.  Syria remains in ruins while peace remains remote. Meanwhile, natural disasters are worsening the man-made disaster of conflict.In the face of these mounting crises, the global humanitarian system is on the verge of collapse.  Needs are rising.  And funding is drying up.  Our humanitarian operations are being forced to make massive cuts.  But, if we don’t feed the hungry, we are feeding conflict. I urge all countries to step up and to fund fully the Global Humanitarian Appeal.The peace and security architecture is under unprecedented strain. That is why, in the context of the preparations for the Summit of the Future, we put forward ideas for the consideration of Member States for a New Agenda for Peace, based on the Charter and international law.It provides a unifying vision to address existing and new threats for a world in transition, calling on States to recommit to a world free from nuclear weapons, and to end the erosion of the nuclear disarmament and arms control regime; bolstering prevention at the global level by maximizing the capacity and convening power of the UN and our good offices to bridge geopolitical divides.Bolstering prevention at the national level by linking actions for peace with progress on the Sustainable Development Goals; putting women’s leadership and participation at the centre of decision-making and committing to the eradication of all forms of violence against women.Calling for a broad-based reflection on peacekeeping and make it nimbler and more adaptable, with forward-looking transition and exit strategies from the start; and supporting peace enforcement action by regional organizations — notably the African Union — with clear Security Council mandates and predictable funding.Determination for peace also requires new governance frameworks for emerging threats, from artificial intelligence to lethal autonomous weapons [systems] that function without human control.Peace is inextricably linked to sustainable development. We see a familiar pattern around the world:  the closer a country is to conflict, the farther it is from the Sustainable Development Goals.  The Charter calls on us to be determined in promoting social progress.  In twenty-first century terms, that means achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.Yet, inequality defines our time:  from cities where skyscrapers tower over slums to countries that are forced to choose between serving their people or servicing their debts.  Today, Africa spends more on debt interest than on health care.Yesterday’s SDG Summit was about a global rescue plan to scale up support from billions to trillions.  The international financial architecture remains dysfunctional, outdated and unjust.  The deep reforms that are needed won’t happen overnight.But, we can take determined steps now to help countries weather crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic [which were] dramatically impacted: by urgently advancing the SDG Stimulus of $500 billion per year and relieving the financial burden on developing and emerging economies; by scaling up development and climate finance — increasing the capital base and changing the business model of multilateral development banks; by ensuring effective debt relief mechanisms and channelling emergency financial support towards those in greatest need.We must be determined to tackle the most immediate threat to our future:  our overheating planet.  Climate change is not just a change in the weather.  Climate change is changing life on our planet.  It is affecting every aspect of our work.  It is killing people and devastating communities.Around the world, we see not only accelerating temperatures, we see an acceleration in sea levels rising, glaciers receding, deadly diseases spreading, the extinction of species and cities under threat.And this is only the beginning.  We have just survived the hottest days, the hottest months and the hottest summer on the books.  Behind every broken record are broken economies, broken lives and whole nations at the breaking point.  Every continent, every region and every country is feeling the heat.But, I’m not sure all leaders are feeling that heat. Actions are falling abysmally short. There is still time to keep rising temperatures within the 1.5°C limits of the Paris Agreement [on climate change].But, that requires drastic steps now:  to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and to ensure climate justice for those who did least to cause the crisis, but are paying the highest price.We have the receipts.  G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse emissions.  They must lead.  They must break their addiction to fossil fuels, stop new coal and heed the International Energy Agency’s findings that new oil and gas licensing by them is incompatible with keeping the 1.5°C limit alive.To stand a fighting chance of limiting global temperature rise, we must phase out coal, oil and gas in a fair and equitable way, and massively boost renewables.  This is the only path to affordable renewable energy for all and importantly many in Africa still lack electricity.So, the fossil fuel age has failed.  If fossil fuel companies want to be part of the solution, they must lead the transition to renewable energy: no more dirty production; no more fake solutions; no more bankrolling climate denial.I have laid out a Climate Solidarity Pact in which all big emitters and are asked to make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies with finance and technology to do so. For example, Africa has 60 per cent of the world’s solar capacity, but just 2 per cent of renewable investments.I have also put forward an Acceleration Agenda to supercharge these efforts.  Developed countries must reach net zero as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 in line with common but differentiated responsibilities.  Immediate steps include:  an end to coal by 2030 for OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries and 2040 for the rest of the world; an end to fossil fuel subsidies; and a price on carbon.Developed countries must also finally deliver the $100 billion for developing country climate action, as promised; double adaptation finance by 2025, as promised; and replenish the Green Climate Fund, as promised.  All countries must work to operationalize the loss and damage fund this year.  And ensure universal Early Warning coverage by 2027.Tomorrow, I will welcome credible first movers and doers to our Climate Ambition Summit.  COP28 [twenty-eighth United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] is around the corner.  Climate chaos is breaking new records, but we cannot afford the same old broken record of scapegoating and waiting for others to move first.And to all those working, marching and championing real climate action, I want you to know that you are on the right side of history and that I am with you.  I won’t give up this fight of our lives. We must also be determined to honour the Charter’s commitment to fundamental human rights.  Just four women signed our founding document.  One look around this room shows not enough has changed.  “We, the Peoples” does not mean “We, the men.”Women are still waiting for equal opportunities and equal pay; for equality under the law; for their work to be valued and their opinions to count.  Around the globe, women’s rights – including sexual and reproductive rights - are being suppressed and even rolled back, and women’s freedoms curtailed.In some countries, women and girls are punished for wearing too many clothes; in others, for wearing too few.  Thanks to generations of women’s rights activists, times are changing.  From sports fields to schools and public squares, girls and women are challenging the patriarchy -- and winning.  I stand with them.I entered this office with a commitment to ensuring gender parity at the UN.  We achieved that at senior levels and are on track to do so across the UN system. Because gender equality is not the problem.  Gender equality is the solution.  It is not a favour to women; it is fundamental to ensuring a better future for all.We must be determined to answer the Call to Action to put human rights at the heart of our work.  Seventy-five years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there has been enormous progress in some areas, from ending colonization and segregation to ensuring women’s voting rights.But, we have not achieved basic rights for all when 1.2 billion people still live in acute poverty, and hunger is at levels not seen since 2005:  when discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds is perfectly legal in many countries; when people must risk death to seek a better life; when refugees, migrants and minorities are routinely demonized and hounded; when declaring your gender identity or simply who you love can lead to imprisonment or even execution; when speaking out can lead to perilous consequences.Human rights — political, civil, economic, social and cultural – are the key to solving many of the world’s interlinked problems. Laws to protect the vulnerable must be enacted and enforced; the targeting of minorities must stop; and human rights and human dignity must be at the centre of social, economic and migration policies.  All Governments must fulfil the commitment they made in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We must also face up to the looming threats posed to human rights by new technology.  Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds much promise, but it may also lead us across a Rubicon and into more danger than we can control.When I mentioned artificial intelligence in my General Assembly speech in 2017, only two other leaders even uttered the term.  Now AI is on everyone’s lips — a subject of both awe and fear.  Even some of those who developed generative AI are calling for greater regulation.But, many of the dangers of digital technology are not looming. They are here.  The digital divide is inflaming inequalities.  Hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media platforms are spread and amplified by AI, undermining democracy and fuelling violence and conflict in real life.  Online surveillance and data harvesting are enabling human rights abuses on a mass scale.  And technology companies and Governments are far from finding solutions.We must move fast and mend things.  New technologies require new and innovative forms of governance — with input from experts building this technology and from those monitoring its abuses.And we urgently need a Global Digital Compact — between Governments, regional organizations, the private sector and civil society — to mitigate the risks of digital technologies and identify ways to harness their benefits for the good of humanity.Some have called for consideration of a new global entity on AI that could provide a source of information and expertise for Member States. There are many different models – inspired by such examples as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The UN stands ready to host the global and inclusive discussions that are needed, depending on the decisions of Member States.  To help advance the search for concrete governance solutions, I will appoint this month a High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which will provide recommendations by the end of this year.Next year’s Summit of the Future is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for progress to deal with these new threats, in line with the vision of the UN Charter.Member States will decide how to move forward on the New Agenda for Peace, the Global Digital Compact, reforms to the international financial architecture, and many other proposals to address challenges and bring greater justice and equity to global governance.The United Nations was created precisely for moments like this — moments of maximum danger and minimum agreement.  We can and must use our tools in flexible and creative ways.  Last month, we saw the dividends of determination off the coast of Yemen.  Carrying 1 million barrels of oil, the decaying FSO Safer supertanker was a ticking time bomb — a looming ecological disaster in the Red Sea.But, no one offered to solve the problem.  So, the United Nations stepped in and brought the world together.  We mobilized resources, assembled the experts, navigated difficult negotiations and built trust.We have more work ahead and more resources are needed. But, last month, the oil was successfully transferred from the Safer.  This UN-led action saved the Red Sea.  When no one else could or would, UN determination got the job done.Despite our long list of global challenges, that same spirit of determination can guide us forward.  Let us be determined to heal divisions and forge peace:  determined to uphold the dignity and worth of every person; determined to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind; determined to reform multilateralism for the twenty-first century and come together for the common good.  Thank you.\n"

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals, in New York today:Eight years ago, Member States gathered in this Hall to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  With the world watching — including 193 young people in the balcony holding blue lamps of hope — you made a solemn promise.  A promise to build a world of health, progress and opportunity for all.  A promise to leave no one behind.  And a promise to pay for it.This was not a promise made to one another as diplomats from the comfort of this chamber.  It was — always — a promise to people.  People crushed under the grinding wheels of poverty.  People starving in a world of plenty.  Children denied a seat in a classroom.  Families fleeing conflicts, seeking a better life.  Parents watching helplessly as their children die of preventable disease.  People losing hope because they can’t find a job — or a safety net when they need it. Entire communities literally on devastation’s doorstep because of changing climate.So, the SDGs aren’t just a list of goals.  They carry the hopes, dreams, rights and expectations of people everywhere.  And they provide the surest path to living up to our obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now in its seventy-fifth year.Yet today, only 15 per cent of the targets are on track and many are going in reverse.  Instead of leaving no one behind, we risk leaving the SDGs behind.  So, Excellencies, the SDGs need a global rescue plan.  I am deeply encouraged by the detailed and wide-ranging draft political declaration under discussion here today — especially its commitment to improving developing countries’ access to the fuel required for SDG progress: finance.This includes clear support for an SDG Stimulus of at least $500 billion a year, as well as an effective debt-relief mechanism that supports payment suspensions, longer lending terms, and lower rates.  It includes a call to re-capitalize and change the business model of multilateral development banks so they can massively leverage private finance at affordable rates to benefit developing countries.  And it includes the endorsement of the need to reform the international financial architecture that I consider outdated, dysfunctional and unfair.  This can be a game-changer in accelerating SDG progress.I have been calling for a new Bretton Woods moment, and the development of practical solutions by the Summit of the Future next September.  But countries can act right now to get the SDGs on track.Together with businesses and financial institutions, local authorities, the United Nations development system and more, you have helped point the way with high-impact initiatives to support six targeted areas where urgent transitions are needed.First — we must take action on hunger.  In our world of plenty, hunger is a shocking stain on humanity, and an epic human rights violation.  It is an indictment of every one of us that millions of people are starving in this day and age.  Building on July’s Food Systems Summit Stocktake, we are marshalling finance, science, data, innovations, and policy and governance support to help countries transform food systems so all people can access a healthy and nutritious diet.Second — the transition to renewable energy isn’t happening fast enough.  We are putting forward new Energy Compacts in which governments, businesses and global organizations join forces to invest in decarbonizing energy systems, and ensuring a just and equitable transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Third — the benefits and opportunities of digitalization are not being spread widely enough.  To close the divide, we have launched an initiative to spur digital transformation across 100 countries, supporting stronger technology capacities, better governance, and innovative financing.  Our proposed Global Digital Compact will also help countries build safe digital systems that provide internet access for all — including for students in hard-to-reach communities.Fourth — too many children and young people are victims of poor-quality education, or no education at all.  We need to build true “learning societies” anchored in quality education — including lifelong learning from the earliest years to adulthood — closing the digital divide, and supporting teachers every step of the way. An emerging group of “frontrunner countries” is leading the way in boosting investment and transforming education systems around the world.Fifth — people need decent work and social protection.  Working with governments and the private sector, our Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions aims to create 400 million new decent jobs — especially in the green, care and digital economies — and extend social protection to over 4 billion people.  Investments in social protection should be massively increased.And sixth — the war on nature must stop.  We must end the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.  We’re building a group of champion countries to explore how to reform economic policies, and put nature and biodiversity at the heart of all decision-making.  Cutting across all of these transitions is the need to ensure full gender equality.  It’s long past time to end discrimination, ensure a place at every table for women and girls, and the end the scourge of gender-based violence.At the halfway point to the SDG deadline, the eyes of the world are on you once again.  Over the course of the weekend, young people and civil society groups came to the United Nations — or marched in communities around the world — demanding urgent action. Now is the time to prove you are listening.We can prevail.  If we act now.  If we act together.  If we keep our promise to the billions of people whose hopes, dreams and futures you hold in your hands.  Now is the time.\n",

      "Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks at the United Nations General Assembly high-level side event on Chad titled “The journey towards constitutional order in Chad:  Invitation to a meeting of exchange and reinforcement of partnerships”, in New York today:We gather at an important moment for Chad, its partners, its supporters and the whole region.  The transition is approaching its last mile — the final sprint — after covering a vast amount of ground through challenging terrain.Our meeting provides a crucial opportunity to take stock, exchange honest views, hear from the authorities about their needs and priorities, and marshal our full resources to meet the expectations of the Chadian people.The stakes are high.  Regional pressures are immense — Chad has opened its arms to hundreds of thousands of people that are fleeing violence in Sudan, on top of an existing refugee and displaced population.I witnessed this remarkable generosity and hospitality firsthand when I visited Adré and Farchana in eastern Chad.  But, I have also seen the immense pressure this has put on the limited resources of Chadians, who have been doubly impacted by the crisis in neighbouring country in Sudan.Global pressures are high — the General Assembly, our global town hall for our global village, is convening to reinvigorate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but this is amid heightened geopolitical divisions, growing military expenditure and a never-ending war on nature.In the face of these crises, it is easy to fall into a survival instinct and take a short-term approach — reacting to events rather than responding and engaging with them.Through this transition, Chad is charting a different way forward — a more demanding one that should continue to be underpinned by inclusivity for the prosperity of both current and future generations.The United Nations stands with Chad every step of the way in navigating its path to a prosperous, inclusive future.  Guided by the needs and priorities of Chad articulated in the new Cooperation Framework, which officially begins in January next year, the United Nations is dedicated to the realization of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.We are also committed to accompanying and supporting Chad in its transition.  Today’s joint event is symbolic of our unwavering engagement.  However, it is pertinent to note that a large part of the transition has been undertaken by Chad.The Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Central Africa — Abdou Abarry — has been working diligently with other regional actors, including the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), to support an inclusive, peaceful and timely return to constitutional order.Our support also means a commitment to advance the Doha Peace agreement, including disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and to help the Government’s commendable efforts to rid its territory of land mines.It means accompanying national efforts to strengthen social cohesion, pursue the SDGs, provide humanitarian support and promote human rights.Chad needs our full and unwavering support in a region of turmoil, humanitarian crises and a rapidly changing climate.I thank and commend partners who have stood by and supported Chad.  But, as Chad embarks on the last — and most challenging — mile of the transition, we need to stay the course to support and partner with Chad to build a prosperous and peaceful future that leaves no one behind.\n"

      "Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message to the International Climate and Energy Summit, in Madrid today:I am pleased to join you for this International Climate and Energy Summit.  And I thank the Government of Spain and the International Energy Agency for bringing us together.You meet in Madrid to strengthen the coalition to respond to a defining challenge of our times:  Saving the 1.5°C limit, by cleaning up global energy.  Time is short, but it is possible.  The International Energy Agency’s new Net Zero Roadmap shows us that.  But we need action now.First, action at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change].  I urge you to work together, in Madrid, and in the United Arab Emirates, to secure a strong outcome in response to the Global Stocktake.  That must include commitments to double energy efficiency, triple renewables capacity, cut methane from the energy sector by 75 per cent, and ensure universal access to energy — all by 2030.These efforts must be accompanied by a collective commitment to accelerate a fair and just phase-out of fossil fuels, as we bring clean power to all.  One without the other equals failure.Second, action from Governments.  I have proposed an Acceleration Agenda.  This calls on Governments to speed up net-zero timelines — so that developed countries get there as close as possible to 2040 and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050.  And it urges all Governments to put in place credible actions, policies and plans that are compatible with a 1.5°C world, and for developed countries to deliver climate justice to those on the front lines of the crisis.That includes, amongst other measures, putting a stop to new coal and phasing out existing coal; shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables — subsidies the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates reached $7 trillion last year; and ending new oil and gas licensing.Developed countries must honour the $100 billion commitment, and replenish the Green Climate Fund.  And we must push the multilateral development banks to adapt their business models to leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries so they can reduce emissions and adapt.Third, we need action from business.  The Acceleration Agenda calls on companies — including fossil fuel companies — to create credible transition plans across the entire value chain.  All this is eminently achievable.The Climate Ambition Summit I hosted in New York last month indicated a collective way forward.  And it showed that action to meet the 1.5°C limit is not a dream.  It is practical and it is possible.  We know what needs to be done.  Let’s do it.\n",

      "Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks at the Global Citizen Festival, in New York today:Hello, New York.  You are really quiet today.  Hello, New York.Come rain or shine, we’re here because we are committed to our planet.  And what happens today is a reflection of leaders meeting all week, promises made seven years ago, and today we’re recommitting to what the great Al Pacino said, tell it like it is:  it’s half-time, and we’re down … but we’re not out.People are hurting, and wars are raging, and our planet has gone from warming to boiling.  Leaders are really struggling to use their power to keep the promises of the global goals and they risk breaking that promise to billions of people.The good news is, we still got seven years to go, and every game is won or lost in the second half.  So, what are you going to do?  Are you sitting on the sidelines?  No.  Are you changing the world?  Yes.  I didn’t hear you.  Are you changing the world?Well, at the United Nations, we’re joining you, we are mobilizing people around the world.  But we can’t do this alone.  We need all hands on deck — and we need each and every one of you.We need leaders to urgently tackle the climate crisis because we can’t win unless we stop our world from heating up.  We need leaders to bridge the digital divide — because we can’t win if billions of people, especially girls, are left offline and left behind. And we need leaders to achieve gender equality — because we can’t win when half the team isn’t even on the field.So, New Yorkers, it’s crunch time — but crunch time is when champions are made.Let’s unite and fight together — inch by inch — to keep the promise of achieving the global goals by 2030.  New York, are you with me?  New York, are you with the world?\n",

      "Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message to the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), today:My visits to small island States in the Caribbean and the Pacific have had an enormous impact on me and my ideas on the role of multilateral institutions.I have seen some of the most beautiful places on Earth, but I have also seen the enormity of the threat you face from climate chaos — a threat that is existential.  And I have witnessed the leadership, resilience and unity you bring to the table.Today, your countries are at the centre of a storm of global problems you have done almost nothing to create:  the continued, brutal economic impacts of the pandemic, soaring food and fuel prices, crippling debts and the climate crisis, accelerating with a deadly force that can wipe out homes and livelihoods in moments.It is little wonder you are struggling to invest in climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals.  That means livelihoods being lost, communities without health care, and young people left to wonder whether the place they call home can survive.We need global action to end these crises.  First, on climate justice:  we need AOSIS to continue its climate advocacy.  To keep using your moral authority to push the G7 and the G20 to slash emissions and limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C.Small island States do not lack ambition, they lack finance. Developed countries must deliver, honouring the promise of $100 billion a year, replenishing the Green Climate Fund, and delivering a road map to double adaptation finance by 2025.At COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], all parties must operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, which you have done so much to champion.  And every person on earth must be protected by an early warning system by 2027. I thank all of you involved in the Early Warning Systems for All Initiative.Second, action on financial justice.  I am calling for fundamental reform of our outdated and unfair global financial architecture.  And I have proposed an SDG Stimulus to increase resources for sustainable development and provide effective debt relief.Loan agreements must include disaster clauses.  And we must remove the barriers that prevent some small island States from accessing affordable finance.Most small island States are middle-income countries.  We need to move past a system that allocates concessional finance depending on national income, to one that considers vulnerability and resilience.  The work of the High-Level Panel of the Multi-Dimensional Vulnerability Index is vital.  And I hope there will be political consensus on the way forward.Next year’s Conference on Small Island Developing States in Antigua and Barbuda, will be an opportunity to bring the international community together around the challenges you face.  With global action for climate justice and financial justice, we can create the change you need.  The United Nations is with you, every step of the way.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the ministerial meeting on the Summit of the Future, in New York today:My report on Our Common Agenda called for renewed trust and solidarity between peoples, countries and generations.  It proposed a reformed multilateralism to reflect and address today’s political and economic realities.Today, the need for such reforms is clearer than ever.  We face a host of consequential and even existential risks, without the multilateral systems needed to manage them.  We are moving towards a multipolar world.Multipolarity is creating new opportunities for different countries to lead on the global stage.  But, history teaches that multipolarity without strong multilateral institutions creates serious risks.  It could result in even greater geostrategic tensions, chaotic competition and further fragmentation.Multilateral institutions will only survive if they are truly universal.  The Summit of the Future is a unique opportunity to help rebuild trust and bring outdated multilateral institutions and frameworks into line with today’s world, based on equity and solidarity.  But, it is more than an opportunity.  It is an essential means of reducing risks and creating a safer and more peaceful world.I welcome your agreement that the Summit of the Future will adopt an intergovernmentally negotiated Pact for the Future, reaffirming the United Nations Charter; reinvigorating multilateralism; boosting implementation of existing commitments; and agreeing on solutions to new challenges.I also welcome your decision to work towards a Pact covering five baskets of issues: sustainable development and financing for development; international peace and security; science, technology and innovation, and digital cooperation; youth and future generations; [and] transforming global governance.I commend your pledge to advance human rights, the empowerment of women and girls, and acceleration towards the Sustainable Development Goals.  You, the Member States, will decide what to take forward within these five groups of issues into the Pact for the Future.We have shared a series of concrete proposals for your consideration in eleven policy briefs. These proposals cover:  A New Agenda for Peace that would reinvigorate our collective security framework; a global financial system that works for all; economic metrics that go beyond GDP [gross domestic product] to underpin policy decisions; a compact that would harness the benefits and manage the risks of digital technologies and artificial intelligence; a voluntary code of conduct on information integrity online; new protocols to manage global shocks more effectively; stronger cooperation in outer space; a transformation of education systems; the meaningful inclusion of young people in global decision‑making processes; ways to safeguard the future and uphold the rights of future generations; and a UN 2.0, better equipped to support Member States through the use of data, digital tools, innovation, foresight and behavioural science.Our proposals deepen the vision of Our Common Agenda, turning the original recommendations into concrete, achievable steps towards fairer, more sustainable, universal and effective global systems.  I also welcome the contributions of the High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, which deserve your serious consideration and I thank the Co-Chair for the excellent work that was done by the group.And I commend the progress that has already been made on many of the mandated Our Common Agenda recommendations, through the debates convened last year by the President of the General Assembly; the establishment of the UN Youth Office; the five transformative measures for gender equality; the new vision for the rule of law; the Global Accelerator on jobs and social protection; and plans for the proposed open Biennial Summit among members of the G20 [Group of 20], ECOSOC [Economic and Social Council], leaders of international financial institutions and myself as Secretary-General of the United Nations.The Pact for the Future will be your contract with each other and with your people.  It represents your pledge to use all the tools at your disposal at the global level to solve problems, before those problems overwhelm us.  The challenges we face are universal. They require universal solutions and cannot be solved through small groupings of states or coalitions of the willing.The United Nations is the only forum where this can happen.  It will also be important to welcome the contributions of civil society, academia, the private sector and other important stakeholders.The stakes are high.  A substantive, comprehensive Pact for the Future has the potential to turbocharge implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in line with the declaration of the SDG Summit. It will help to determine whether we meet the serious challenges of today and tomorrow, or continue down the path of social, financial, political and environmental breakdown.  Let me stress that this Pact will fully complement and reinforce our efforts to achieve the SDGs and create a more peaceful, sustainable and equitable world today. But, let’s be clear.  Time is not on our side.  In the two years since my report on Our Common Agenda, new conflicts have emerged and geopolitical tensions are higher than ever.  We have crossed a new Rubicon with generative AI. We are seeing the signs of climate breakdown.  Billions of people around the world have been hit by the cost-of-living crisis.  And more countries than ever are struggling with debt distress or default.We cannot inch towards agreement while the world races towards a precipice.  We must bring a new urgency to our efforts, and a shared sense of common purpose.  Let us draw inspiration from recent global agreements on global biodiversity, on the high seas, on climate loss and damage, and on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.Reaching agreement will be difficult.  But, it is possible.  I urge you to redouble your efforts over the coming year to ensure that the Pact for the Future is ambitious and transformative.The Summit of the Future must also be a moment to reinforce the connection between global governance and the people of the world.  The Pact for the Future must reflect the priorities and concerns of women and men struggling to feed their families, and communities bearing the brunt of the climate emergency.  It must offer solutions for a better, fairer, more peaceful and more sustainable world. Above all, it must demonstrate that multilateralism can deliver for everyone, everywhere.  Thank you.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council open debate on “Upholding the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter through Effective Multilateralism:  Maintenance of Peace and Security of Ukraine”, in New York today:The United Nations Charter is our roadmap to a more peaceful world.  The tools and mechanisms founded on the principles of the Charter are a how-to manual to resolve conflict.  Together, our collective efforts over the years have contributed to preventing war on a global scale and saving millions of lives through peacemaking and preventive diplomacy, UN peacekeeping operations, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, humanitarian and development programmes, and activities to promote human rights.Just this week, the SDG Summit agreed on a rescue plan for the Sustainable Development Goals — an essential tool to prevent conflict and crises of all kinds.  Multilateralism works.  It is essential and effective.  But multilateral tools and mechanisms are weakening.  In the face of rising geopolitical tensions and challenges, some are failing while others — frameworks that are urgently needed — do not yet exist.The number of conflict-related deaths last year almost doubled.  United Nations peace operations are under unprecedented strain.  Nuclear disarmament is at a virtual standstill.  And there are no adequate global frameworks to address the security threats posed by new technologies.I urge Governments to go further and do better to recommit to their obligations under the United Nations Charter, to use the full range of diplomatic tools that it provides, to prioritize the prevention of conflict and crises and to consider the proposals for new frameworks and tools in the New Agenda for Peace.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in clear violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, is aggravating geopolitical tensions and divisions, threatening regional stability, increasing the nuclear threat, and creating deep fissures in our increasingly multipolar world.  All this comes at a time when cooperation and compromise for multilateral solutions are needed more than ever to tackle challenges from the climate crisis to unprecedented levels of inequality to disruptive technologies.The United Nations organs have been clear in condemning the war. The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved one resolution demanding that Russia leave Ukraine, and a second rejecting Russia’s efforts to annex Ukrainian territory.  I have consistently and repeatedly called for a just and sustainable peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter and international law — for Ukraine, for Russia, and for the world.Russia’s invasion was followed by relentless, systematic attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure and services, including health and education facilities.  The war has killed or injured tens of thousands of civilians, destroyed lives and livelihoods, traumatized a generation of children, torn families and communities apart, devastated the economy and turned vast areas of farmland into deadly minefields.Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop immediately.  Nearly half of Ukraine’s population — some 18 million people — need humanitarian assistance and protection.  More than 6 million Ukrainians have fled the country.  The United Nations has worked collectively to mitigate the impact on people, both in Ukraine and around the world and to support civilians. Our humanitarian programmes have stepped up, distributing aid to more than 8 million people this year in partnership with over 450 humanitarian organizations, half of them Ukrainian.The International Atomic Energy Agency has established a presence at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and other major Ukrainian nuclear sites, to monitor safety, security and safeguards.  Together with the International Committee of the Red Cross, we successfully organized the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol last year.Evidence of shocking and widespread human rights violations has been documented by UN agencies, including conflict-related sexual violence, arbitrary detentions; summary executions — mostly by the Russian Federation — and the forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians, including children, to territory under Russian control or to the Russian Federation. This documentation is vital for accountability.  Accountability for all human rights violations is crucial, in line with international norms and standards.The war contributed to an unprecedented surge in global food prices, threatening millions with hunger and poverty.  Starting in July 2022, we succeeded in mitigating that impact through the Black Sea Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Nations and the Russian Federation.During its one-year period of operation, the Black Sea Initiative, together with the Memorandum of Understanding on facilitating exports of Russian food products and fertilizers, helped to reduce global food prices by over 23 per cent from the record high reached in March last year. The Black Sea Initiative enabled the export of nearly 33 million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs and allowed the World Food Programme to transport 725,000 metric tons of wheat for humanitarian aid to countries including Afghanistan and Somalia.Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the United Nations delivered solutions on several of the most challenging areas of trade facilitation for Russian food and fertilizers, with continuous work on the remaining issues.We deeply regret that Russia ended its participation in the Black Sea Initiative in July of this year.  And that, immediately upon leaving, Russia launched a bombardment of Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities on the Black Sea and the Danube River.Attacks against terminals and grain stores are unacceptable and such assaults must end.  Civilian shipping in the Black Sea has also been threatened.  Further escalation could instantly shock the markets and destabilize the region.  Volatility and uncertainty have already returned to international grain markets, while supplies from the harvest in Ukraine pile up.The bombardment is also undermining our efforts in the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Russian Federation. It has led many of those whose goodwill is needed, notably in the private sector, to question whether there is any real interest in re-joining the Black Sea Initiative.We remain engaged with all parties, aiming to ensure safe and secure exports of grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine. These must be put on a stable footing, without the repeated threat of interruption. I am grateful to the Government of Türkiye for its contributions and urge all Member States to support our efforts.The United Nations continues to work towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter, international law, and the resolutions of the General Assembly.  I urge all countries to do their part to prevent further escalation, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace.  We are fully committed to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders.This war is already causing limitless suffering.  Its continuation risks further perilous escalation.  There is never an alternative to dialogue, diplomacy, and a just peace.  Thank you.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ opening remarks to the Climate Ambition Summit, in New York today:Our focus here is on climate solutions — and our task is urgent. Humanity has opened the gates of hell. Horrendous heat is having horrendous effects.  Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands are fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.Climate action is dwarfed by the scale of the challenge.  If nothing changes we are heading towards a 2.8°C temperature rise — towards a dangerous and unstable world.But, the future is not fixed.  It is for leaders like you to write it.  We can still limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C.  We can still build a world of clear air, green jobs and affordable clean power for all.The path forward is clear.  It has been forged by fighters and trailblazers — some of whom are with us today:  Activists refusing to be silenced; indigenous peoples defending their lands from climate extremes; chief executives transforming their business models and financiers funding a just transition; mayors moving towards to a zero-carbon future; and Governments working to stamp out fossil fuels and protect vulnerable communities.But, if we are to meet the 1.5°C limit and protect ourselves from climate extremes, climate champions, particularly in the developing world, need solidarity, they need support and they need global leaders to take action.  Action to reduce emissions.The move from fossil fuels to renewables is happening — but we are decades behind.  We must make up time lost to foot-dragging, arm-twisting and the naked greed of entrenched interests raking in billions from fossil fuels.The proposed Climate Solidarity Pact calls on major emitters — who have benefitted most from fossil fuels — to make extra efforts to cut emissions, and on wealthy countries to support emerging economies to do so.And the Acceleration Agenda I proposed calls on Governments to hit fast forward:  So that developed countries reach net zero as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.It also urges countries to implement a fair, equitable and just energy transition, while providing affordable electricity to all: By ensuring credible plans to exit coal by 2030 for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and 2040 for the rest of the world; by ending fossil fuel subsidies — which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates reached an incredible $7 trillion in 2022; and by setting ambitious renewable energy goals in line with the 1.5°C limit.The Acceleration Agenda also calls for climate justice.  Many of the poorest nations have every right to be angry.  Angry that they are suffering most from a climate crisis they did nothing to create. Angry that promised finance has not materialized.  And angry that their borrowing costs are sky-high.We need a transformation to rebuild trust.  Governments must push the global financial system towards supporting climate action.  That means putting a price on carbon, and overhauling the business models of multilateral development banks so that they leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.All parties must operationalize the loss and damage fund at the twenty-eighth UN Climate Change Conference.  Developed countries must meet the $100 billion commitment, replenish the Green Climate Fund and double adaptation funding.  And everyone must be covered by an early warning system by 2027 — by implementing the action plan we launched last year.At the same time, my Acceleration Agenda calls for business and financial institutions to embark on true net-zero pathways.  Shady pledges have betrayed the public trust.  Shamefully, some companies have even tried to block the transition to net zero — using wealth and influence to delay, distract and deceive.Every company that truly means business must create just transition plans that credibly cut emissions and deliver climate justice, in line with the recommendations of my High-Level Expert Group.The future of humanity is in your hands.  One summit will not change the world.  But, today can be a powerful moment to generate momentum, that we build on over the coming months.We can — and we must turn up the tempo.  Turn plans into action.  And turn the tide.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks at the General Assembly High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, in New York today:Of all the issues we will discuss this week, finance may be the most crucial, because financing for development is the fuel that drives progress on the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement [for climate change]. Today, that fuel is running out and the sustainable development engine is stuttering, stalling and backfiring.As we mark the halfway point of the Sustainable Development Goals, progress on our most fundamental priorities — poverty and hunger — has gone into reverse for the first time in decades.  The COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis are having a devastating and lasting impact on developing economies.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated volatility and increased prices for food, energy and finance.  A global cost-of-living crisis is affecting billions of people.  Governments are drowning in debt.  Soaring interest rates are squeezing developing countries dry.Official development assistance and climate finance commitments are not being met.  There is a stark and growing divide between countries that can access financing at reasonable terms and those that cannot and are being left even further behind.The figures tell their own story.  Let me provide three.  The SDG financing gap has become a chasm, estimated at $3.9 trillion a year.  Developing countries face borrowing costs up to eight times higher than those of European countries in particular, and this is a debt trap.And one in three countries around the world is now at high risk of a fiscal crisis.  Over 40 per cent of people living in extreme poverty are in countries with severe debt challenges.There have been some good-faith efforts to help developing economies survive this financing crisis, including the G20 [Group of 20] Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the distribution of special drawing rights by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  But, they are not enough.It is clear that the systemic problems of financing for sustainable development require a systemic solution:  reforms of the global financial architecture.  That architecture was created at a time when many of today’s developing countries were still under colonial rule.  It is deeply skewed in favour of the developed world.And it has not kept pace with the growth of the global economy.  The paid-in capital of the World Bank for example as a percentage of global GDP is one fifth what it was in 1960.I reiterate my call for a new Bretton Woods moment when countries come together to agree on a global financial architecture that reflects today’s economic realities and power relations.  I count on your support for these proposed reforms, through the Summit of the Future and beyond.But, while these structural reforms are essential, they will take time — and time is short.  The 2030 Agenda may fall beyond our reach before they bear fruit.  I am therefore calling on Governments to take immediate steps to rescue the SDGs.My proposed SDG Stimulus would release at least $500 billion per year in affordable long-term financing for investments in sustainable development and climate action.  Increasing the capital base of multilateral development banks and changing their business model would enable Governments to scale up development and climate investments significantly.Recapitalization and stronger engagement with credit rated agencies would enable the banks to transform their approach to risk, improving their lending terms and leveraging massive amounts of private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.Governments could create an effective debt workout mechanism to support payment suspensions, include private creditors, and extend to middle-income countries.  They can also increase contingency financing when countries run into trouble.  I am calling for the rechannelling of an additional $100 billion of special drawing rights, primarily through the multilateral development banks, and for other innovative methods to help countries in need.Developed countries must make good on their finance commitments to developing countries, including on climate.  They must meet the $100 billion promise, significantly increase adaptation finance, replenish the Green Climate Fund and operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund by COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ].  And all countries must align national budgets with the SDGs, and address tax abatement and illicit financial flows.Discussions on reform on the financing architecture are taking place from Bridgetown to Paris to Delhi.  I welcome the G20’s support for the SDG Stimulus, strengthening Multilateral Development Banks, and increasing finance for development and climate action.The SDG Summit Declaration is a ringing endorsement of strong financing measures to rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.  Now we must move from words to urgent action, because the SDGs — a promise to the people of the world — cannot wait.  A two-track world of haves and have-nots is already driving a crisis in global trust.I urge you to use this high-level dialogue as a platform for constructive engagement, with a focus on creative and practical financing solutions that can be taken forward in the next months and years.  Together, we must turn this moment of crisis into a moment of opportunity, find joint financing solutions to rebuild global solidarity, and create new momentum for sustainable development and climate action. And I thank you.\n",

      "Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ address to the opening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, in New York today:Just nine days ago, many of the world’s challenges coalesced in an awful hellscape.  Thousands of people in Derna, Libya, lost their lives in epic, unprecedented flooding. They were victims many times over — victims of years of conflict, victims of climate chaos, victims of leaders, near and far, who failed to find a way to peace.The people of Derna lived and died in the epicentre of that indifference, as the skies unleashed 100 times the monthly rainfall in 24 hours, as dams broke after years of war and neglect, as everything they knew was wiped off the map.Even now, as we speak, bodies are washing ashore from the same Mediterranean Sea where billionaires sunbathe on their superyachts. Derna is a sad snapshot of the state of our world — the flood of inequity, of injustice, of inability to confront the challenges in our midst.Our world is becoming unhinged.  Geopolitical tensions are rising.  Global challenges are mounting.  And we seem incapable of coming together to respond.  We confront a host of existential threats — from the climate crisis to disruptive technologies — and we do so at a time of chaotic transition.For much of the cold war, international relations were largely seen through the prism of two superpowers.  Then came a short period of unipolarity.  Now we are rapidly moving towards a multipolar world.  This is, in many ways, positive.  It brings new opportunities for justice and balance in international relations.  But, multipolarity alone cannot guarantee peace.At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe had numerous Powers.  It was truly multipolar.  But, it lacked robust multilateral institutions and the result was the First World War.A multipolar world needs strong and effective multilateral institutions.  Yet global governance is stuck in time.  Look no further than the United Nations Security Council and the Bretton Woods system. They reflect the political and economic realities of 1945, when many countries in this Assembly Hall were still under colonial domination.The world has changed.  Our institutions have not.  We cannot effectively address problems as they are if institutions do not reflect the world as it is.  Instead of solving problems, they risk becoming part of the problem.  And indeed, divides are deepening:  divides among economic and military Powers, divides between north and south, east and west.We are inching ever closer to a great fracture in economic and financial systems and trade relations, one that threatens a single, open internet, with diverging strategies on technology and artificial intelligence, and potentially clashing security frameworks.It is high time to renew multilateral institutions based on twenty-first century economic and political realities, rooted in equity, solidarity and universality and anchored in the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.That means reforming the Security Council in line with the world of today.  It means redesigning the international financial architecture so that it becomes truly universal and serves as a global safety net for developing countries in trouble.I have no illusions.  Reforms are a question of power.  I know there are many competing interests and agendas.  But, the alternative to reform is not the status quo. The alternative to reform is further fragmentation.  It is reform or rupture.At the same time, divides are also widening within countries. Democracy is under threat. Authoritarianism is on the march. Inequalities are growing.  And hate speech is on the rise.  In the face of all these challenges and more, compromise has become a dirty word.Our world needs statesmanship, not gamesmanship and gridlock. As I told the G20 [Group of 20], it is time for a global compromise.  Politics is compromise.  Diplomacy is compromise.  Effective leadership is compromise.  Leaders have a [special] responsibility to achieve compromise in building a common future of peace and prosperity for our common good.Over the past year, we have shown the promise of multilateral action.  With important new agreements on safeguarding biodiversity — on protecting the high seas, on climate loss and damage, on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.We have all the tools and resources to solve our shared challenges.  What we need is determination.  Determination is in the DNA of our United Nations — summoning us with the first words of the Charter:  “We the peoples of the United Nations […] determined”:  determined to end the scourge of war; determined to reaffirm faith in human rights; determined to uphold justice and respect international law; and determined to promote social progress and better lives for all people.It falls to us — through our actions — to apply that determination to the challenges of today being faithful to the Charter of the United Nations.  It starts with determination to uphold the Charter’s pledge for peace.Yet, instead of ending the scourge of war, we are seeing a surge of conflicts, coups and chaos.  If every country fulfilled its obligations under the Charter, the right to peace would be guaranteed.  When countries break those pledges, they create a world of insecurity for everyone.Exhibit A:  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The war, in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, has unleashed a nexus of horror:  lives destroyed, human rights abused, families torn apart, children traumatized, hopes and dreams shattered.But, beyond Ukraine, the war has serious implications for us all.  Nuclear threats put us all at risk.  Ignoring global treaties and conventions makes us all less safe.  And the poisoning of global diplomacy obstructs progress across the board.We must not relent in working for peace — a just peace in line with the UN Charter and international law.  And even while fighting rages, we must pursue every avenue to ease the suffering of civilians in Ukraine and beyond.  The Black Sea Initiative was one such avenue.  The world badly needs Ukrainian food and Russian food and fertilizers to stabilize markets and guarantee food security and I will not give up on my efforts to make it happen.Around the globe, old tensions fester while new risks emerge. Nuclear disarmament is at a standstill while countries develop new weapons and make new threats.  Across the Sahel, a series of coups is further destabilizing the region as terrorism is gaining ground.  Sudan is descending into full-scale civil war, millions have fled and the country risks splitting apart.In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, millions are displaced and gender-based violence is a horrific daily reality.  In Haiti, a country that suffered centuries of colonial exploitation is today overwhelmed by gang violence, and still awaits international support.In Afghanistan, a staggering 70 per cent of the population needs humanitarian assistance with the rights of women and girls systematically denied.  In Myanmar, brutal violence, worsening poverty and repression are crushing hopes for a return to democracy.In the Middle East, escalating violence and bloodshed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is taking a terrible toll on civilians. Unilateral actions are intensifying and undermining the possibility of a two-State solution — the only pathway to lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.  Syria remains in ruins while peace remains remote. Meanwhile, natural disasters are worsening the man-made disaster of conflict.In the face of these mounting crises, the global humanitarian system is on the verge of collapse.  Needs are rising.  And funding is drying up.  Our humanitarian operations are being forced to make massive cuts.  But, if we don’t feed the hungry, we are feeding conflict. I urge all countries to step up and to fund fully the Global Humanitarian Appeal.The peace and security architecture is under unprecedented strain. That is why, in the context of the preparations for the Summit of the Future, we put forward ideas for the consideration of Member States for a New Agenda for Peace, based on the Charter and international law.It provides a unifying vision to address existing and new threats for a world in transition, calling on States to recommit to a world free from nuclear weapons, and to end the erosion of the nuclear disarmament and arms control regime; bolstering prevention at the global level by maximizing the capacity and convening power of the UN and our good offices to bridge geopolitical divides.Bolstering prevention at the national level by linking actions for peace with progress on the Sustainable Development Goals; putting women’s leadership and participation at the centre of decision-making and committing to the eradication of all forms of violence against women.Calling for a broad-based reflection on peacekeeping and make it nimbler and more adaptable, with forward-looking transition and exit strategies from the start; and supporting peace enforcement action by regional organizations — notably the African Union — with clear Security Council mandates and predictable funding.Determination for peace also requires new governance frameworks for emerging threats, from artificial intelligence to lethal autonomous weapons [systems] that function without human control.Peace is inextricably linked to sustainable development. We see a familiar pattern around the world:  the closer a country is to conflict, the farther it is from the Sustainable Development Goals.  The Charter calls on us to be determined in promoting social progress.  In twenty-first century terms, that means achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.Yet, inequality defines our time:  from cities where skyscrapers tower over slums to countries that are forced to choose between serving their people or servicing their debts.  Today, Africa spends more on debt interest than on health care.Yesterday’s SDG Summit was about a global rescue plan to scale up support from billions to trillions.  The international financial architecture remains dysfunctional, outdated and unjust.  The deep reforms that are needed won’t happen overnight.But, we can take determined steps now to help countries weather crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic [which were] dramatically impacted: by urgently advancing the SDG Stimulus of $500 billion per year and relieving the financial burden on developing and emerging economies; by scaling up development and climate finance — increasing the capital base and changing the business model of multilateral development banks; by ensuring effective debt relief mechanisms and channelling emergency financial support towards those in greatest need.We must be determined to tackle the most immediate threat to our future:  our overheating planet.  Climate change is not just a change in the weather.  Climate change is changing life on our planet.  It is affecting every aspect of our work.  It is killing people and devastating communities.Around the world, we see not only accelerating temperatures, we see an acceleration in sea levels rising, glaciers receding, deadly diseases spreading, the extinction of species and cities under threat.And this is only the beginning.  We have just survived the hottest days, the hottest months and the hottest summer on the books.  Behind every broken record are broken economies, broken lives and whole nations at the breaking point.  Every continent, every region and every country is feeling the heat.But, I’m not sure all leaders are feeling that heat. Actions are falling abysmally short. There is still time to keep rising temperatures within the 1.5°C limits of the Paris Agreement [on climate change].But, that requires drastic steps now:  to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and to ensure climate justice for those who did least to cause the crisis, but are paying the highest price.We have the receipts.  G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse emissions.  They must lead.  They must break their addiction to fossil fuels, stop new coal and heed the International Energy Agency’s findings that new oil and gas licensing by them is incompatible with keeping the 1.5°C limit alive.To stand a fighting chance of limiting global temperature rise, we must phase out coal, oil and gas in a fair and equitable way, and massively boost renewables.  This is the only path to affordable renewable energy for all and importantly many in Africa still lack electricity.So, the fossil fuel age has failed.  If fossil fuel companies want to be part of the solution, they must lead the transition to renewable energy: no more dirty production; no more fake solutions; no more bankrolling climate denial.I have laid out a Climate Solidarity Pact in which all big emitters and are asked to make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies with finance and technology to do so. For example, Africa has 60 per cent of the world’s solar capacity, but just 2 per cent of renewable investments.I have also put forward an Acceleration Agenda to supercharge these efforts.  Developed countries must reach net zero as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 in line with common but differentiated responsibilities.  Immediate steps include:  an end to coal by 2030 for OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries and 2040 for the rest of the world; an end to fossil fuel subsidies; and a price on carbon.Developed countries must also finally deliver the $100 billion for developing country climate action, as promised; double adaptation finance by 2025, as promised; and replenish the Green Climate Fund, as promised.  All countries must work to operationalize the loss and damage fund this year.  And ensure universal Early Warning coverage by 2027.Tomorrow, I will welcome credible first movers and doers to our Climate Ambition Summit.  COP28 [twenty-eighth United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] is around the corner.  Climate chaos is breaking new records, but we cannot afford the same old broken record of scapegoating and waiting for others to move first.And to all those working, marching and championing real climate action, I want you to know that you are on the right side of history and that I am with you.  I won’t give up this fight of our lives. We must also be determined to honour the Charter’s commitment to fundamental human rights.  Just four women signed our founding document.  One look around this room shows not enough has changed.  “We, the Peoples” does not mean “We, the men.”Women are still waiting for equal opportunities and equal pay; for equality under the law; for their work to be valued and their opinions to count.  Around the globe, women’s rights – including sexual and reproductive rights - are being suppressed and even rolled back, and women’s freedoms curtailed.In some countries, women and girls are punished for wearing too many clothes; in others, for wearing too few.  Thanks to generations of women’s rights activists, times are changing.  From sports fields to schools and public squares, girls and women are challenging the patriarchy -- and winning.  I stand with them.I entered this office with a commitment to ensuring gender parity at the UN.  We achieved that at senior levels and are on track to do so across the UN system. Because gender equality is not the problem.  Gender equality is the solution.  It is not a favour to women; it is fundamental to ensuring a better future for all.We must be determined to answer the Call to Action to put human rights at the heart of our work.  Seventy-five years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there has been enormous progress in some areas, from ending colonization and segregation to ensuring women’s voting rights.But, we have not achieved basic rights for all when 1.2 billion people still live in acute poverty, and hunger is at levels not seen since 2005:  when discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds is perfectly legal in many countries; when people must risk death to seek a better life; when refugees, migrants and minorities are routinely demonized and hounded; when declaring your gender identity or simply who you love can lead to imprisonment or even execution; when speaking out can lead to perilous consequences.Human rights — political, civil, economic, social and cultural – are the key to solving many of the world’s interlinked problems. Laws to protect the vulnerable must be enacted and enforced; the targeting of minorities must stop; and human rights and human dignity must be at the centre of social, economic and migration policies.  All Governments must fulfil the commitment they made in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We must also face up to the looming threats posed to human rights by new technology.  Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds much promise, but it may also lead us across a Rubicon and into more danger than we can control.When I mentioned artificial intelligence in my General Assembly speech in 2017, only two other leaders even uttered the term.  Now AI is on everyone’s lips — a subject of both awe and fear.  Even some of those who developed generative AI are calling for greater regulation.But, many of the dangers of digital technology are not looming. They are here.  The digital divide is inflaming inequalities.  Hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media platforms are spread and amplified by AI, undermining democracy and fuelling violence and conflict in real life.  Online surveillance and data harvesting are enabling human rights abuses on a mass scale.  And technology companies and Governments are far from finding solutions.We must move fast and mend things.  New technologies require new and innovative forms of governance — with input from experts building this technology and from those monitoring its abuses.And we urgently need a Global Digital Compact — between Governments, regional organizations, the private sector and civil society — to mitigate the risks of digital technologies and identify ways to harness their benefits for the good of humanity.Some have called for consideration of a new global entity on AI that could provide a source of information and expertise for Member States. There are many different models – inspired by such examples as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The UN stands ready to host the global and inclusive discussions that are needed, depending on the decisions of Member States.  To help advance the search for concrete governance solutions, I will appoint this month a High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which will provide recommendations by the end of this year.Next year’s Summit of the Future is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for progress to deal with these new threats, in line with the vision of the UN Charter.Member States will decide how to move forward on the New Agenda for Peace, the Global Digital Compact, reforms to the international financial architecture, and many other proposals to address challenges and bring greater justice and equity to global governance.The United Nations was created precisely for moments like this — moments of maximum danger and minimum agreement.  We can and must use our tools in flexible and creative ways.  Last month, we saw the dividends of determination off the coast of Yemen.  Carrying 1 million barrels of oil, the decaying FSO Safer supertanker was a ticking time bomb — a looming ecological disaster in the Red Sea.But, no one offered to solve the problem.  So, the United Nations stepped in and brought the world together.  We mobilized resources, assembled the experts, navigated difficult negotiations and built trust.We have more work ahead and more resources are needed. But, last month, the oil was successfully transferred from the Safer.  This UN-led action saved the Red Sea.  When no one else could or would, UN determination got the job done.Despite our long list of global challenges, that same spirit of determination can guide us forward.  Let us be determined to heal divisions and forge peace:  determined to uphold the dignity and worth of every person; determined to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind; determined to reform multilateralism for the twenty-first century and come together for the common good.  Thank you.\n",

      "Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development Goals, in New York today:Eight years ago, Member States gathered in this Hall to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  With the world watching — including 193 young people in the balcony holding blue lamps of hope — you made a solemn promise.  A promise to build a world of health, progress and opportunity for all.  A promise to leave no one behind.  And a promise to pay for it.This was not a promise made to one another as diplomats from the comfort of this chamber.  It was — always — a promise to people.  People crushed under the grinding wheels of poverty.  People starving in a world of plenty.  Children denied a seat in a classroom.  Families fleeing conflicts, seeking a better life.  Parents watching helplessly as their children die of preventable disease.  People losing hope because they can’t find a job — or a safety net when they need it. Entire communities literally on devastation’s doorstep because of changing climate.So, the SDGs aren’t just a list of goals.  They carry the hopes, dreams, rights and expectations of people everywhere.  And they provide the surest path to living up to our obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now in its seventy-fifth year.Yet today, only 15 per cent of the targets are on track and many are going in reverse.  Instead of leaving no one behind, we risk leaving the SDGs behind.  So, Excellencies, the SDGs need a global rescue plan.  I am deeply encouraged by the detailed and wide-ranging draft political declaration under discussion here today — especially its commitment to improving developing countries’ access to the fuel required for SDG progress: finance.This includes clear support for an SDG Stimulus of at least $500 billion a year, as well as an effective debt-relief mechanism that supports payment suspensions, longer lending terms, and lower rates.  It includes a call to re-capitalize and change the business model of multilateral development banks so they can massively leverage private finance at affordable rates to benefit developing countries.  And it includes the endorsement of the need to reform the international financial architecture that I consider outdated, dysfunctional and unfair.  This can be a game-changer in accelerating SDG progress.I have been calling for a new Bretton Woods moment, and the development of practical solutions by the Summit of the Future next September.  But countries can act right now to get the SDGs on track.Together with businesses and financial institutions, local authorities, the United Nations development system and more, you have helped point the way with high-impact initiatives to support six targeted areas where urgent transitions are needed.First — we must take action on hunger.  In our world of plenty, hunger is a shocking stain on humanity, and an epic human rights violation.  It is an indictment of every one of us that millions of people are starving in this day and age.  Building on July’s Food Systems Summit Stocktake, we are marshalling finance, science, data, innovations, and policy and governance support to help countries transform food systems so all people can access a healthy and nutritious diet.Second — the transition to renewable energy isn’t happening fast enough.  We are putting forward new Energy Compacts in which governments, businesses and global organizations join forces to invest in decarbonizing energy systems, and ensuring a just and equitable transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Third — the benefits and opportunities of digitalization are not being spread widely enough.  To close the divide, we have launched an initiative to spur digital transformation across 100 countries, supporting stronger technology capacities, better governance, and innovative financing.  Our proposed Global Digital Compact will also help countries build safe digital systems that provide internet access for all — including for students in hard-to-reach communities.Fourth — too many children and young people are victims of poor-quality education, or no education at all.  We need to build true “learning societies” anchored in quality education — including lifelong learning from the earliest years to adulthood — closing the digital divide, and supporting teachers every step of the way. An emerging group of “frontrunner countries” is leading the way in boosting investment and transforming education systems around the world.Fifth — people need decent work and social protection.  Working with governments and the private sector, our Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions aims to create 400 million new decent jobs — especially in the green, care and digital economies — and extend social protection to over 4 billion people.  Investments in social protection should be massively increased.And sixth — the war on nature must stop.  We must end the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.  We’re building a group of champion countries to explore how to reform economic policies, and put nature and biodiversity at the heart of all decision-making.  Cutting across all of these transitions is the need to ensure full gender equality.  It’s long past time to end discrimination, ensure a place at every table for women and girls, and the end the scourge of gender-based violence.At the halfway point to the SDG deadline, the eyes of the world are on you once again.  Over the course of the weekend, young people and civil society groups came to the United Nations — or marched in communities around the world — demanding urgent action. Now is the time to prove you are listening.We can prevail.  If we act now.  If we act together.  If we keep our promise to the billions of people whose hopes, dreams and futures you hold in your hands.  Now is the time.\n",

      "Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks at the United Nations General Assembly high-level side event on Chad titled “The journey towards constitutional order in Chad:  Invitation to a meeting of exchange and reinforcement of partnerships”, in New York today:We gather at an important moment for Chad, its partners, its supporters and the whole region.  The transition is approaching its last mile — the final sprint — after covering a vast amount of ground through challenging terrain.Our meeting provides a crucial opportunity to take stock, exchange honest views, hear from the authorities about their needs and priorities, and marshal our full resources to meet the expectations of the Chadian people.The stakes are high.  Regional pressures are immense — Chad has opened its arms to hundreds of thousands of people that are fleeing violence in Sudan, on top of an existing refugee and displaced population.I witnessed this remarkable generosity and hospitality firsthand when I visited Adré and Farchana in eastern Chad.  But, I have also seen the immense pressure this has put on the limited resources of Chadians, who have been doubly impacted by the crisis in neighbouring country in Sudan.Global pressures are high — the General Assembly, our global town hall for our global village, is convening to reinvigorate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but this is amid heightened geopolitical divisions, growing military expenditure and a never-ending war on nature.In the face of these crises, it is easy to fall into a survival instinct and take a short-term approach — reacting to events rather than responding and engaging with them.Through this transition, Chad is charting a different way forward — a more demanding one that should continue to be underpinned by inclusivity for the prosperity of both current and future generations.The United Nations stands with Chad every step of the way in navigating its path to a prosperous, inclusive future.  Guided by the needs and priorities of Chad articulated in the new Cooperation Framework, which officially begins in January next year, the United Nations is dedicated to the realization of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.We are also committed to accompanying and supporting Chad in its transition.  Today’s joint event is symbolic of our unwavering engagement.  However, it is pertinent to note that a large part of the transition has been undertaken by Chad.The Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Central Africa — Abdou Abarry — has been working diligently with other regional actors, including the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), to support an inclusive, peaceful and timely return to constitutional order.Our support also means a commitment to advance the Doha Peace agreement, including disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and to help the Government’s commendable efforts to rid its territory of land mines.It means accompanying national efforts to strengthen social cohesion, pursue the SDGs, provide humanitarian support and promote human rights.Chad needs our full and unwavering support in a region of turmoil, humanitarian crises and a rapidly changing climate.I thank and commend partners who have stood by and supported Chad.  But, as Chad embarks on the last — and most challenging — mile of the transition, we need to stay the course to support and partner with Chad to build a prosperous and peaceful future that leaves no one behind.\n"

Following Tuesday’s heated plenary debate with the Polish prime minister and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, MEPs “deeply deplore” the decision of 7 October 2021 “as an attack on the European community of values and laws as a whole”, and say that the Tribunal has been transformed “into a tool for legalising the illegal activities of the authorities”.\n",

Following Tuesday’s heated plenary debate with the Polish prime minister and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, MEPs “deeply deplore” the decision of 7 October 2021 “as an attack on the European community of values and laws as a whole”, and say that the Tribunal has been transformed “into a tool for legalising the illegal activities of the authorities”.\n",

The Bulgarian and Dutch plans have not yet been submitted and the Hungarian, Polish and Swedish plans are waiting to be approved by the Commission. He insisted that while the Commission is completing its assessment of the remaining three plans he would not provide views on pre-assessments and individual plans.\n",
      "During the debate, most MEPs called for the approval process to be more transparent to allow them to understand what steps the Hungarian and Polish governments have taken to address concerns about the rule of law and attacks on the judiciary, primacy of EU law, public procurement, corruption and unequal treatment of minorities.\n",
      "Many MEPs also said that the Commission should not approve the plans unless all deficiencies are properly addressed in line with budget conditionality rules protecting the EU’s financial interests and taxpayers’ money. At the same time, they highlighted that they are not acting against ordinary Hungarian and Polish citizens; on the contrary, they want to make sure that EU money goes to people and companies in need and not to corrupt politicians.\n",
